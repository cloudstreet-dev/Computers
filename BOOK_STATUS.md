- Code examples are functional and demonstrate key concepts
- Mathematical foundations are properly explained

## Next Steps

To complete the book, the remaining 8 chapters need to be written:
- Computer Networks (TCP/IP, routing, protocols)
- Distributed Systems (consensus, replication, CAP theorem)
- Compilers (parsing, code generation, optimization)
- Software Engineering (methodologies, testing, patterns)
